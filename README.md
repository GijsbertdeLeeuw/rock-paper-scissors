 Points will be given by the rules in the following list.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Another level</h2>
<p>At another level,this game is a study case of<br />
 <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101">"The Odin Project" course in web-development 101.></a></p>
<p>I can highly recommend this course because it gives me all the freedom to show my creativity.</p>

<h2>Some more ....</h2>
<p>I looked in the kitchen of some other developer's and there were program's I couldn't read at all. Other program's were very basic, still there was nothing out there worth of copying. That's why I started from scrap and with a lot, a lot of try and errors, I understood some of the basics in developing websites. Hence I'm satisfied with this product for the moment.</p>    
<p>When you know that the computer plays 100 % random (random is not entirely random, like a dice, but for this game it complies), it makes the game very booring.</p>
<p>Possible improvements to this program could be:
<ul>
<li>Make a DUMB mode: Computer Choices are fully random. (like now)</li>
<li>Make a SMART mode: Computer Choice depends on psychological rules. (based on human preferences and behaviour)</li>
<li>Make a Log-in: Computer can act on databased choices of a certain person. </li>
<li>Make a CHEAT mode: Computer still acts random on certain moves but with knowledge of player's choice.(with propability percentage)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Happy Programming ..... </h2>
